Hitch
=====

Hitch is a testing framework for writing integration tests with an emphasis on:

* :doc:`/glossary/test_realism`
* :doc:`/glossary/test_readability`
* :doc:`/glossary/loose_coupling`
* Minimizing or eliminating the scourge of :doc:`/glossary/brittle_tests`
* Tests that :doc:`/glossary/fail_fast` and :doc:`/glossary/fail_clearly`.

In addition, the framework creates a :doc:`/glossary/test_driven_development_environment` that:

* Automates its own deployment and does not interfere with your system other than to install packages.
* Runs reliably without modification on Mac OS X, Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, CentOS and Arch.
* Provides first class debugging tools.
