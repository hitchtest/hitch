Clarifying documentation
========================

Was there something you were confused about? Are you having problems with hitch?

If you are finding a test hard to implement or a problem with the framework
hard to fix, please raise an issue:

https://github.com/hitchtest/hitch/issues/new

*Even if you think the problem was probably your fault* we really want to hear
from you. There's a good chance if you're confused that the documentation or
even the code is deficient in some way and we'd like to fix that.

Support queries are the lifeblood of this framework. Without them it will
wither and die.

Thanks for helping out!
