Why does Hitch not enforce the use of Given/When/Then?
------------------------------------------------------

The two core principles behind the :doc:`/glossary/hitch_test_description_language`
is :doc:`DRY`, :doc:`/glossary/test_readability` and simplicity.

While hitch is designed with :doc:`/glossary/test_readability` in
mind.

Hitch does not require the use of Given/When/Then since the language
prioritizes terseness and :doc:`DRY`. However, you can still use
the given/when/then approach in your step names.
