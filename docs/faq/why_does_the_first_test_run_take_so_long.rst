Why does the first test run take so long?
-----------------------------------------

Your first test run can take a long, long time because hitch often
needs to download and compile the software used to run your test with.

This means that the first test run of one test can take in the region
of 45 minutes while subsequent runs of the same test take 20 seconds.
