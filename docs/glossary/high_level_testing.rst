High Level Testing
==================

In general, high level testing:

* Enables more realistic test scenarios, enabling it to catch more real bugs
* Is frequently less convenient to run (sometimes requiring special hardware)
* Allows you to create test scenarios which are more understandable to customers
* Is almost always integration testing
* Is more loosely coupled and does not require changing as often when you change code underneath it
* Is often expensive
* Is slow

High level testing is nearly always a form of :doc:`integration_testing`.
