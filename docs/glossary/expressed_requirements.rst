Expressed requirements
======================

Expressed requirements are requirements directly expressed by a customer.

Expressed requirements often come in the form of a proposed solution which
obscures critical details of the actual problem faced by the customer and the
varying importance of the problems the customer is asking to be solved.

Proposed solutions can often also come with design flaws.
