Customer representative
=======================

Customer representative is a *role* on a development team taken
by one or more members whose job it is to represent customers.

A customer representative is always a :doc:`stakeholder_representative`
but a stakeholder representative is necessarily a customer representative.

The necessary tasks undertaken by the customer rep include:

* Liasing with customers and determining their :doc:`true_requirements`.
* Writing the ubiquitous language as test cases in collaboration with developers and customers - both for bug reports and implementing features.
* :doc:`exploratory_testing`

Customer representatives can be anybody although the role is usually
best performed either by QA, product managers or developers with a
good understanding of the problem domain and good communication skills.

Customers usually make poor representatives of themselves.

Good customer representative skills include:

* The ability to take non-technical customers' proposed solutions and walk back from them to determine their core problems (see :doc:`true_requirements` vs :doc:`expressed_requirements`).
* A strong understanding of the problem domain and its various quirks.
* An ability to consider and imagine a wide variety of potential edge cases, sub-problems and non-considered problems early on before their non-specification affects development.
* A limited level of *declarative* programming skill (e.g. ability to use Excel effectively, write clean HTML or do simple programming).
* Good communication skills, *especially* the ability to use language precisely.
* UI/UX design skills (where UI/UX design skills are not on hand).
* Empathy
