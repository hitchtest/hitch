Customer representative
=======================

Customer representative is a *role* on a development team taken
by one or more members whose job it is to represent customers.

This can mean:

* Liasing with customers and determining their true requirements.
* Writing specifications
* Writing test cases
* Reading bug reports
* Translating bug reports into failing test cases

Customer representatives can be anybody although the role is usually
best performed either by QA, product managers or developers with a
good understanding of the problem domain.

Good customer representative skills include:

* Empathy
* The ability to take customers' proposed solutions and walk back from them to determine their core problems.
* An ability to consider a wide variety of edge cases.
* A limited level of programming skill (e.g. ability to use Excel).
* UI/UX design skills.

.. warning::

    Customers themselves usually make poor representatives of themselves.
