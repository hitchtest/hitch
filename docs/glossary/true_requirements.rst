True Requirements
=================

True requirements are customers' *actual* requirements which usually differ from
their :doc:`expressed_requirements`.

Most customers often think in terms of a solution that would fix their problem
rather than the problem itself, especially when the problem is one that they
have tried to solve themselves via other means.

True requirements come in the form of a precisely defined high level problem which
the customers would like to see solved, free from implementation details.

:doc:`behavior_driven_development` is a useful tool that can be used in order
engage the customer and to draw out true requirements.
