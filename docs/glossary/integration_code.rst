Integration code
================

Integration code is code that largely integrates disparate systems, APIs
and systems together.

Contrast with :doc:`logical_code`.

Integration code is nearly always better suited to being tested with
:doc:`integration_tests` whereas logical code is better suited to being
tested with :doc:`unit_tests`.
