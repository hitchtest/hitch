Hitch Settings
==============

Hitch settings are a set of configuration variables read by the :doc:`execution_engine`.

They are usually set on a per-environment basis, either via the command
line or a settings file. For example, a continuous integration environment
will have a different set of settings to a test driven development environment.

Contrast with :doc:`preconditions` which are essentially test-specific
settings.
