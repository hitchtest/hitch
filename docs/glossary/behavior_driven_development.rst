Behavior Driven Development
===========================

See : :doc:`/howto/behavior_driven_development`

Hitch aims to be a framework that *enables* behavior driven development
and makes it an obvious approach to take by removing roadblocks to doing it
although it is not, by any means, a framework that *requires* you to do BDD.
It can just be used for writing tests.

Two aspects of hitch in particular were built to make hitch well suited to BDD:

* :doc:`test_readability` - the 'dumb', extra simple nature of the :doc:`hitch_test_description_language` makes it more suitable as a communications tool with stakeholders while still being possible to turn it into an executable test case.
* Enforced loose :doc:`coupling` at all levels (e.g. see: :doc:`/faq/why_just_html_ids_and_classes`).
