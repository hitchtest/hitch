Behavior Driven Development
===========================

See: `Behavior Driven Development Wikipedia Page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development>`_

Hitch aims to be a framework that *enables* behavior driven development
but does not force you to follow this approach.

Two aspects in particular make hitch suited to this approach:

* :doc:`test_readability` - the 'dumb', simple nature of the :doc:`hitch_test_description_language` makes it suitable as a tool for communication with stakeholders.
* :doc:`loose_coupling` - the enforced loose coupling between your application, the testing system and the different components of the testing system allows a much more flexible approach to writing tests, letting you write them at virtually any level of abstraction.
