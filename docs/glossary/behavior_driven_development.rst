Behavior Driven Development
===========================

See : :doc:`/howto/behavior_driven_development`

Hitch aims to be a framework that *enables* behavior driven development and,
indeed, make it an obvious approach to take, but there is no requirement
that you do BDD with hitch.

If you just want to use it to write tests, you can.

Two aspects of hitch in particular were designed to make hitch well suited to BDD:

* :doc:`test_readability` - the 'dumb', extra simple nature of the :doc:`hitch_test_description_language` makes it more suitable as a communications tool with stakeholders while still being possible to turn it into an executable test case.
* Enforced loose :doc:`coupling` at all levels (e.g. see: :doc:`/faq/why_just_html_ids_and_classes`).
