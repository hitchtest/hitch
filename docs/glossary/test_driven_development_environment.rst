Test Driven Development Environment
===================================

A test driven development environment is a *development environment* in
which tools are provided such that, in most (say, 90% of cases):

* Mimicking realistic test scenarios that demonstrate features and replicate bugs is straightforward and quick.
* A test-first first development approach is easy as a non-test first development approach.
* Debugging tools are integrated into the testing environment and easily available.
