Requirements Angst
==================

Requirements angst is a persistent worry that the programmer is not entirely
sure of the requirements they are developing to.

Requirements angst is a persistent form of uncertainty and hence stress,
which reduces programmers' productivity.

Requirements angst can be minimized by building code against an automated
acceptance test.
