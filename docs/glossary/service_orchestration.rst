Service Orchestration
=====================

Service orchestration refers to the process of starting, stopping,
monitoring and interacting with service based applications.

On most UNIX systems this is handled by the "init" system - this
is usually SystemV, Upstart or SystemD.

Hitch has a plugin to do this called :doc:`hitchserve`.
