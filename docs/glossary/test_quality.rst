Test Quality
============

Test quality is a measure of how *well* a project is covered by its tests.

The following are indicative of test quality:

* High :doc:`environmental_coverage`
* Test-to-code :doc:`coupling`
* High :doc:`code_coverage`
* High :doc:`test_isolation`
* :doc:`DRY`ness
* High :doc:`test_speed` (not as important as it's usually made out to be though)
