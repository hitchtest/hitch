Automated Acceptance Tests
==========================

Automated acceptance tests are automated tests which double
as :doc:`acceptance_tests`.

When automated acceptance tests that are both :doc:`business_readable`
and executable, they can eliminate :doc:`requirements_angst`
as well as giving a better high level overview of what features
are done and which features have yet to be finished.

Acceptance testing is usually also:

* :doc:`high_level_testing`
* :doc:`integration_testing`
* :doc:`end_to_end_testing`

See also:

* :doc:`acceptance_tests`
