End to End Testing
==================

End to end testing is a form of :doc:`/glossary/integration_testing` that covers your entire application
and mimics realistic scenarios by your users.

End to end test characteristics:

* Can, if designed correctly, exhibit a very high level of a :doc:`/glossary/test_realism`, catching more bugs than any other kind of test.
* Are typically slower than lower level tests.

End to end tests are typically the most useful environment for:

* :doc:`/glossary/acceptance_testing`
* :doc:`/glossary/exploratory_testing`
* Reproducing bugs reported by end users
