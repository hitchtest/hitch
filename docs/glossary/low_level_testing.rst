Low Level Testing
=================

In general, low level testing:

* Does not enable realistic test scenarios
* Is very convenient to run
* Catches fewer bugs
* Is not understandable at all to customers
* Is cheap to run
* Is tightly coupled and requires changing when you change the code it couples to
* Is fast

Low level testing can be :doc:`integration_testing` or :doc:`unit_testing`,
though there is usually a bias towards unit testing.
