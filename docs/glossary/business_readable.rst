Business readable
=================

Business readable is a term used by the :doc:`behavior_driven_development` community to refer to a language
that can be read and understood by "the business". This in essence means computer code that is simple enough
that it can be understood by a non-programmer.

Business readable does not mean:

* That the language is necessarily easy for the business to write.
* That the language is easily understood by a layman. Business readable still assumes a requisite level of domain knowledge and an understanding of specialist terminology.

The :doc:`hitch_test_description_language` aims to be business readable.
