Regression Testing
==================

Regression testing is a form of testing done on new versions of code to
ensure that old functionality was not inadvertently broken.

Almost all regression testing should be done via :doc:`automated_testing`
except where the cost of building a harness would be prohibitive.

Regression testing via :doc:`brain_dead_manual_testing` is a common
:doc:`testing_antipattern`.
