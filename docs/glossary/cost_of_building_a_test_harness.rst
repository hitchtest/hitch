Cost of building a test harness
===============================

The cost of building a :doc:`test_harness` is a factor that should be
used to determine whether to use :doc:`manual_test_driven_development` or
:doc:`acceptance_test_driven_development`.

Hitch aims to substantially bring down the cost of building a test harness
by providing common tools and a framework for writing readable, maintainable
tests for a multitude of different domains. (see :doc:`test_readability`).

Nonetheless, even with Hitch, it is not always necessarily cost effective
to build a test harness.
