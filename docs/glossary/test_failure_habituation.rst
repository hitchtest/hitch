Test failure habituation
========================

Test failure habituation is the phenomena whereby developers are conditioned
over time to ignore test failures.

It is primarily caused by :doc:`brittle_tests` and high test maintenance cost.

Neglect of :doc:`test_quality`, the use of poor testing tools and neglect
of maintenance all commonly lead to test failure habituation.

If left unchecked, test failure habituation will *cause* test maintenance
to be neglected, which leads to even greater test failure habituation
in a spiraling :doc:`vicious_cycle`.

Extreme cases of test failure habituation lead to :doc:`test_abandonment`.
