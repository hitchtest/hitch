Test failure habituation
========================

Test failure habituation is the phenomena whereby developers are conditioned
over time to ignore test failures.

It is primarily caused by :doc:`brittle_tests`, which are usually caused
by the use of poor testing tools, test maintenance neglect and poor
:doc:`test_quality`.

If left unchecked, test failure habituation will *cause* test maintenance
to be neglected, which leads to even greater test failure habituation.

Test failure habituation is an example of a :doc:`vicious_cycle`.

Extreme cases of test failure habituation lead to outright
:doc:`test_abandonment`.
