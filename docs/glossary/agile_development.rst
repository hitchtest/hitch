Agile Development
=================

A buzzword, for sure, with far too much marketing and snake oil attached to its meaning.

The term's precise definition is subject to much disagreement and many flamewars
which I don't care about and I won't go into here.

Hitch *only* uses the term to refer to "the opposite of :doc:`waterfall_development`" -
that is, a software development process where requirements gathering, design, testing
and coding for individual features and bug fixes are done in a tight loop over the
course of days (or even hours) rather than weeks, months or even years.

Note that if you're doing :doc:`brain_dead_manual_testing` you should probably stop
calling what you're doing 'agile', no matter what else you're doing.

* :doc:`behavior_driven_development`
* :doc:`acceptance_test_driven_development`
