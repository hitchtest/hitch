Test abandonment
================

Test abandonment is the final stage of :doc:`test_failure_habituation` when
tests become so unmaintained and ignored that their results effectively become
meaningless.

Test abandonment is usually paired with an increased reliance on different
kinds of testing and quality control - e.g. :doc:`brain_dead_manual_testing`,
unit testing or sometimes even relying on users to catch and report bugs.

Test abandonment also frequently goes hand in hand with a regression from
:doc:`agile_development` back to :doc:`waterfall_development` and an overall
decrease in project quality.
