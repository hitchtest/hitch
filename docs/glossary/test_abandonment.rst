Test abandonment
================

Test abandonment is the final stage of :doc:`test_failure_habituation` when
tests become so unmaintained and ignored that they effectively become
meaningless.

Test abandonment is often paired with an increased reliance on different
kinds of testing - e.g. unit tests or manual testing.

Test abandonment can be the death knell of a project.
