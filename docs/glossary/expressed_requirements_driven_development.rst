Expressed Requirements Driven Development
=========================================

:doc:`expressed_requirements` driven development is an :doc:`antipattern`
whereby developers and/or customer representatives follow the expressed
requirements of customers unquestioningly. This usually leads to the following
problems:

* Customers unknowingly make design decisions which adversely impact the product.
* Customers propose solutions which do not adequately solve their problem.
* Customers do not specify critical aspects of the problem until a later stage in development - for example proper system behavior during critical edge cases.
* Customers unknowingly propose solutions which are expensive to build and do not represent a good cost/benefit trade off.
* Customers do not communicate the relative importance of the problems and sub-problems they wish to see solved, often leading to cost overruns and high mean time to market.
