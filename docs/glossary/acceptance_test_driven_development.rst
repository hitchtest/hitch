Acceptance Test Driven Development
==================================

Acceptance test driven development is a form of :doc:`test_driven_development`
using :doc:`high_level_testing` where :doc:`acceptance_tests` are written
*before* implementing the code that makes them pass.

Acceptance tests are then subsequently used to provide safety in refactoring.

It is the second part of :doc:`behavior_driven_development`.

See :doc:`/howto/acceptance_test_driven_development`
