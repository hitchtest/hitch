Acceptance Test Driven Development
==================================

Acceptance test driven development is a form of :doc:`test_driven_development`
using :doc:`high_level_testing` where :doc:`acceptance_tests` are written
before implementing the code that makes them pass, and where subsequently,
code is refactored with the protection of the tests in place.

It is the second part of :doc:`behavior_driven_development`.

See :doc:`/howto/acceptance_test_driven_development`
