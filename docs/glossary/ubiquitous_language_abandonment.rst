Ubiquitous Language Abandonment
===============================

Ubiquitous language abandoment is a phenomena whereby project stakeholders
abandon usage of an ubiquitous language, reverting to written or spoken
requirements.

Common causes of ubiquitous language abandonment:

* Lack of a meaningful stakeholder representative or representatives.
* The language is too complex for :doc:`stakeholder representative(s) <stakeholder_representative>` to comprehend - e.g. if it is written using a language that is too :doc:`powerful <language_power>`.
* The language is too low level or repetitive for the :doc:`stakeholder representative(s) <stakeholder_representative>` to maintain their interest.
* Lack of stakeholder interest in precise requirements, edge cases or product design.
* Unwillingness of developers to handle the context switching required to flip between different languages for writing tests and defining requirements.

Ubiquitous language abandonment can lead to unclear requirements,
misinterpreted requirements, poor product design and wasted effort.
