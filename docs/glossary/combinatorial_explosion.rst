Combinatorial Explosion
=======================

The combinatorial explosion is a problem that plagues :doc:`high_level_testing`.

The combinatorial explosion problem can be minimized by testing at a progressively
lower level.

While lower level testing minimizes the combinatorial explosion, it also means
writing more tightly coupled tests.

Combinatorial explosions can also be mitigated by strengthening the typing of your code.
