Test Readability
================

Test readability is the idea that a test should be readable by non-programmers
as a by-product of careful, simple design and the simplicity of the
:doc:`/glossary/test_description_language`.

Test readability does *not* mean that:

* The tests are written in full English sentences.
* The tests do not use complex terminology - if it is relevant to the domain then it is relevant to the test.
* Writing the tests does not require skill.
