Test Driven Development
=======================

Test driven development is a development style where the developer
writes a test *before* implementing a feature.

While it is commonly used to refer only to :doc:`unit_test_driven_development`,
this is not the only form of TDD, and not even a form of TDD that works
most of the time.

Hitch aims to provide a environment where :doc:`acceptance_test_driven_development`
is not only easy to do, it becomes an obvious approach to writing software.
