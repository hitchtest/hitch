Stakeholder Representative
==========================

Stakeholder representative is a role delegated to a person whose job it is
to represent stakeholders on a project.

A :doc:`customer_representative` is always a stakeholder representative but a
stakeholder representative is not always a customer representative.

For instance, a system architect who manages multiple teams may be a stakeholder
representative responsible for defining the API layer between systems which
software on different teams use to communicate with one another.

A stakeholder representative's job is to write specifications using an
:doc:`ubiquitous_language`.
